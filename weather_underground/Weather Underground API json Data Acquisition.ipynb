    "In order to use the API, we need to register for a key. The key does NOT give unlimited access. If you are using the free version (`Stratus Developer`), about 1 year (500 calls per day) can be performed, and 10 requests a minute (you can see this information by [logging in the website](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/) after requesting an API Key, and then selecting `Key Settings` in the upper part of the page. You can also verify on the website how many calls you already performed on a given day and minute on the webpage. \n",

At the time this notebook was created, the endpoint used associated 1 day worth of data to 1 call. As such, if your free account only allow 500 requests, do not exceed 500 days. According to Wu's Terms of Use, a day is defined as:\n",
